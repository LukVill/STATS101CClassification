__Abstract__

Loan applications come from a diverse range of applicants, each generally comprising unique
financial profiles and credit histories. Institutions often face tough decisions about whether to
approve or deny a loan application since this can impact their profits and risk management.
However, the decision taken during the loan application process can also have both negative and
positive impacts for the applicant. For example, a loan approval can enable someone to start a
business or pursue higher education. However, if a loan is denied, it can mean that future borrowing
for someone becomes more challenging or an individual is forced to defer personal ambitions.
This paper aims to build a predictive model for classifying the outcome of mortgage loan
applications. 

The data for this project contains information about mortgage loans from the Wells
Fargo National Bank for the year 2019. Our response variable is action_taken, where 1 represents
loan originated or approved, while 3 denotes loan rejected or denied. The dataset also contains
numerous attributes or variables that may explain loan outcomes. To mention a few, potential
explanatory variables of loan outcome, includes, but are not limited to quantitative attributes, such
as loan amount, term, property value, and income. To illustrate, we believe that individuals with
high disposable income and properties to offer as collateral are more likely to get approved compared
to their counterparts. Categorical factors, such as loan_type, purpose, and socio-demographic
factors, such as age group, location, ethnicity, and sex may also explain loan outcomes, at least
statistically. 

This analysis aims to uncover attributes that are significant in explaining loan
outcomes, which are then exploited to build a loan predictive model that will facilitate more
informed lending decisions.
